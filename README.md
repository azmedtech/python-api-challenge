# python-api-challenge

## Project Title â€“ WeatherPy and VacationPy.

WeatherPy -  Python code, in Jupyter notebook, is used to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Using Citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API, a representative model of weather across cities has been created.

VacationPy - Python code in Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API are used to plan future vacations.

## Visualizations/Results Screenshots
Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
Requirement 3: Using the WaetherPy output .csv file, generate a map that displays a point for every city in the dataframe. 
Requirement 4: After filtering the dataframe for ideal weather conditions, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates, adding the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
